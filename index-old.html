<p style='color:transparent!important'>BGI Ethiopia has been sustainably progressing for almost a century because of our three key assets; our brands, our plantations, and our people. We make sure our brands truly reflect and live up to the promises we make through
    them - providing customers with only the best quality products. Our plantations are more than just our breweries and winery, but also the community living around them. Aside from giving locals job opportunities, we make
    sure to pay our taxes on time and lend a helping hand wherever it is needed. Our people, our employees mean family to us; and like family, we take care of our own in every way we can. We make sure all their needs are met
    and that they are well taken care of both in and outside of work. </p>
